The replan decision has been written. The core issue is clear: this is a checkpoint synchronization problem, not a code failure. The project-scaffold issue (and 13 subsequent issues) were successfully completed and merged to the main branch, but the execution checkpoint doesn't reflect this state. 

The recommended action is **CONTINUE** because:

1. **The work is already done**: Git history confirms issues 01-14 (excluding 13) were successfully completed and merged to main
2. **The failure is infrastructure-related**: The coder agent failed because it was given an impossible task - re-implementing project-scaffold on top of a codebase that already has all the downstream work
3. **No code changes needed**: The project builds successfully, all deliverables exist, and the code is functional
4. **Clear path forward**: The execution system needs to reconcile its checkpoint with git history, mark the completed issues as done, and continue with the remaining work (issues 13, 15, 16)

The Issue Advisor's Strategy 1 recommendation is correct: scan git log for merged issues, update the checkpoint to reflect completed work, and continue DAG execution from where it actually left off.
