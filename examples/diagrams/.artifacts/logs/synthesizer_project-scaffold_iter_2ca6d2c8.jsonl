Complete coverage of all 9 acceptance criteria: (1) cargo build --release exits 0, (2) cargo fmt --check exits 0, (3) cargo clippy -- -D warnings exits 0, (4) Cargo.toml exists, (5) src/ directory exists, (6) Cargo.toml contains [package] with name=diagrams/edition=2021/rust-version=1.70, (7) clap dependency with derive feature, (8) dev-dependencies insta and tempfile, (9) [profile.release] with lto/strip/codegen-units. Coder added 4 edge case tests: TOML parsing validation, main function validation, src/main.rs existence check, and tests/ directory check. No failures detected. Test execution time: 0.08s. Build verification successful.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-01-project-scaffold/.artifacts/coding-loop/2ca6d2c8/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: All acceptance criteria met. Successfully initialized Rust project with Cargo.toml containing correct package metadata (name=diagrams, edition=2021, rust-version=1.70), clap dependency with derive feature, dev dependencies (insta, tempfile), and release profile optimizations. Project structure includes src/main.rs and tests/scaffolding_test.rs with 13 comprehensive tests covering all requirements. No blocking issues found - code is ready to merge.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-01-project-scaffold/.artifacts/coding-loop/2ca6d2c8/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [suggestion] Consider consistent TOML parsing approach: tests/scaffolding_test.rs mixes string-based assertions with structured TOML parsing. Consider using structured parsing throughout or removing the toml dev-dependency for consistency.\n  - [suggestion] Test organization could be improved: All 13 tests are in a single flat file. Consider organizing into test modules (e.g., mod cargo_toml_tests, mod build_tests) for better structure as the test suite grows.\n  - [suggestion] Simplify main.rs placeholder: The main function contains a println statement that's not strictly necessary for scaffolding. Could be simplified to an empty main() function, though current implementation is acceptable.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-01-project-scaffold/.artifacts/coding-loop/2ca6d2c8`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-01-project-scaffold/.artifacts/coding-loop/2ca6d2c8/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
