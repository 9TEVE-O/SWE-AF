{"ts": 1770721286.791321, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: types-module\n- **Title**: Implement core type definitions for AST and layout structures\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - src/types.rs exists and compiles\n  - All types from architecture Component 1 are defined: SourcePosition, NodeType, Node, Connection, Diagram, Point, PositionedNode, PositionedConnection, LayoutDiagram\n  - All constants are defined: DEFAULT_NODE_WIDTH, DEFAULT_NODE_HEIGHT, NODE_HORIZONTAL_SPACING, NODE_VERTICAL_SPACING, SVG_FONT_SIZE, SVG_STROKE_WIDTH, ASCII_NODE_PADDING, ASCII_MIN_NODE_WIDTH\n  - All types derive Debug, Clone, and appropriate traits (PartialEq, Eq where specified)\n  - cargo build succeeds with no warnings\n  - cargo doc --no-deps builds documentation for all public types\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: \u2705 ALL TESTS PASSED \u2014 Comprehensive validation complete. All 6 acceptance criteria met: (AC1) src/types.rs exists and compiles successfully; (AC2) All 9 types defined (SourcePosition, NodeType, Node, Connection, Diagram, Point, PositionedNode, PositionedConnection, LayoutDiagram); (AC3) All 8 constants defined with correct values; (AC4) All types derive Debug, Clone, and appropriate traits (PartialEq, Eq); (AC5) cargo build --release succeeds with zero warnings; (AC6) cargo doc --no-deps builds documentation successfully. Test suite expanded from 50 to 68 tests with enhanced coverage for edge cases including: very long strings (1000+ chars), large collections (100+ items), extreme coordinates (1M+), special characters, fractional values, boundary conditions, and multi-type scenarios. All tests pass including stress tests and validation checks. Zero compilation warnings. Zero clippy warnings. Documentation generated cleanly. Implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for subsequent development phases.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-02-types-module/.artifacts/coding-loop/eeb4c3f8/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with excellent code quality. All 9 types (SourcePosition, NodeType, Node, Connection, Diagram, Point, PositionedNode, PositionedConnection, LayoutDiagram) and 8 constants are defined exactly as specified in the architecture. Types have correct trait derivations (Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq where appropriate). Comprehensive test suite with 50 tests covering instantiation, traits, constants, and edge cases. No blocking issues found. One SHOULD_FIX issue regarding programmatic verification of build/doc acceptance criteria, but this is a minor test coverage enhancement that doesn't affect functionality.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-02-types-module/.artifacts/coding-loop/eeb4c3f8/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Missing test coverage for acceptance criterion verification: The test suite lacks explicit integration tests that verify `cargo build` succeeds with no warnings and `cargo doc --no-deps` builds successfully. While these are typically verified at the CI/build level, having programmatic tests would provide better coverage and ensure acceptance criteria are met explicitly.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-02-types-module/.artifacts/coding-loop/eeb4c3f8`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-diagrams/.worktrees/issue-02-types-module/.artifacts/coding-loop/eeb4c3f8/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
