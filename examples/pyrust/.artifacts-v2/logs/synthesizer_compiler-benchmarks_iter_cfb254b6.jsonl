{"ts": 1770532472.5023081, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: compiler-benchmarks\n- **Title**: Create granular compiler-only benchmarks\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - Create benches/compiler_benchmarks.rs with compiler_simple, compiler_complex, compiler_variables benchmarks\n  - Pre-parse input outside benchmark loop to isolate compiler performance\n  - Criterion generates estimates.json for each benchmark\n  - CV < 5% for all benchmarks\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: False\n- **Summary**: FAILED - Acceptance Criteria 4 (CV < 5%) not met. Test Results: 9/10 tests pass. AC1, AC2, AC3 fully satisfied: benches/compiler_benchmarks.rs exists with all 3 benchmarks (compiler_simple, compiler_complex, compiler_variables), AST correctly pre-parsed outside measurement loop using lexer::lex() and parser::parse(), all estimates.json files generated successfully. AC4 fails: compiler_simple CV=8.12% (203ns), compiler_complex CV=5.12% (330ns), compiler_variables CV=6.86% (381ns) - all exceed 5% threshold. Root cause: System noise dominates at nanosecond timescales (<500ns). This is a specification issue, not implementation defect - the CV < 5% requirement is unrealistic for nanosecond-scale compiler operations. Architecture document acknowledges this (compiler_simple expected 42% CV due to system noise). All 344 library tests pass, demonstrating no regressions. Implementation is functionally correct and follows architecture specification (sample_size=1000, measurement_time=10s). Recommendation: Relax CV requirement to < 10% for sub-500ns benchmarks or accept documented variance as expected behavior.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cfb254b6/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Implementation correctly creates benches/compiler_benchmarks.rs with all three required benchmarks (compiler_simple, compiler_complex, compiler_variables). AST is properly pre-parsed outside benchmark loops using lexer::lex() and parser::parse(), isolating compiler performance as specified. Criterion configuration matches architecture (sample_size=1000, measurement_time=10s). All benchmarks execute successfully and generate estimates.json. AC4 partially met: 2 of 3 benchmarks achieve CV < 5% (compiler_complex: 3.95%, compiler_variables: 4.19%). compiler_simple shows 42% CV due to measurement noise on ultra-fast operation (~187ns), classified as SHOULD_FIX technical debt rather than blocking issue. No security, crash, data loss, or wrong algorithm issues found. Code quality is high with proper black_box usage, comprehensive test coverage, and correct API implementation.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cfb254b6/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] High CV for compiler_simple benchmark exceeds 5% requirement: compiler_simple benchmark shows 42% coefficient of variation, exceeding the AC4 requirement of CV < 5% for all benchmarks. This occurs because the operation is extremely fast (~187ns) and measurement noise dominates. The benchmark is correctly implemented (pre-parses AST, isolates compiler), but the measurement limitation should be documented.\n\n## Iteration History (1 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=AC4 (CV < 5%) is a hard requirement and not met. Only compiler_simple passes (2.71%); compiler_complex (134.53%) and compiler_variables (14.09%) fail. AC1-AC3 pass, code quality is good. Increase measurement duration/sample size, stabilize system environment, and re-run benchmarks to achieve <5% CV for all three benchmarks.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cfb254b6`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cfb254b6/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
