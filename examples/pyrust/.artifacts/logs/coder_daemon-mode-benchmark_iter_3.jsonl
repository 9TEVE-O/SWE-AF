Code changes are correct and mean latency (132\u03bcs) meets target, but high measurement variance blocks approval. Required fixes: (1) Increase warmup from 100\u21921000 runs in validate_daemon_speedup.sh:29, (2) Reuse socket connections instead of connect/disconnect per request to eliminate handshake overhead, (3) Increase sample size from 1000\u21925000 runs. Root cause is socket connection overhead + insufficient warmup, not code correctness. Expected outcome: CV drops to <10% while maintaining sub-190\u03bcs latency.\n\nFix the issues above, then re-commit. Focus on the specific problems identified \u2014 do not rewrite code that is already correct.", "model": "sonnet", "max_turns": 150}
