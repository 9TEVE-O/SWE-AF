Generates final report confirming 50-100x speedup achieved with statistical confidence.\n- **Acceptance Criteria**:\n  - [ ] M1: Binary subprocess \u2264380\u03bcs mean with 95% CI (50x speedup)\n  - [ ] M2: Daemon mode \u2264190\u03bcs mean (100x speedup)\n  - [ ] M3: All 664 currently passing tests still pass\n  - [ ] M4: 681/681 tests passing (100% pass rate)\n  - [ ] M5: All benchmarks CV < 10%\n- **Dependencies**: ['performance-documentation', 'binary-subprocess-benchmark', 'daemon-mode-benchmark', 'cache-performance-benchmark', 'bug-fixes-verification']\n- **Provides**: ['Final validation of all success metrics', 'Comprehensive test and benchmark report', 'Production-ready PyRust CLI']\n- **Files to create**: ['scripts/final_validation.sh']\n- **Testing Strategy**: Create scripts/final_validation.sh that runs: (1) cargo test --release counting passed/failed, (2) all speedup validation scripts, (3) benchmark stability check, (4) cache performance validation. Generate report showing all M1-M5 metrics with pass/fail. Exit 0 only if all metrics pass. Covers M1-M5.\n\n## Project Context\n### PRD Summary\nTransform PyRust from library-optimized (293ns, 66,000x faster) to production-ready CLI achieving 50-100x end-to-end speedup vs CPython (19ms baseline). Current binary execution is 1.3ms (14x speedup) due to process overhead. Solution: (1) Binary optimization with LTO, single codegen unit, symbol stripping to reduce startup to <500\u03bcs, (2) Daemon mode with Unix socket IPC for <190\u03bcs per-request latency amortizing process spawn, (3) Compilation caching with in-memory LRU+SipHash for <50\u03bcs cached execution, (4) Fix 14 failing tests (7 function parameter bugs, 2 negative number parsing, 5 benchmark stability), (5) Add profiling infrastructure for per-stage timing breakdown. Target: `pyrust -c '2+3'` executes in \u2264380\u03bcs mean (binary) or \u2264190\u03bcs (daemon), validated via hyperfine with statistical confidence.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- M1 (Binary Speedup 50x): Binary subprocess execution \u2264380\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 100 runs with 95% CI, automated check `mean_us <= 380` in validation script\n- M2 (Daemon Speedup 100x): Per-request latency in daemon mode \u2264190\u03bcs mean measured via custom benchmark client with 1000 requests, automated check `mean_us <= 190`\n- M3 (Test Regression): All 664 currently passing tests still pass, verified via `cargo test --release` with exit code 0 and 0 failures\n- M4 (Function Bugs Fixed): All 14 failing tests now pass (7 function parameter handling, 2 negative number parsing, 5 benchmark stability), total 681/681 tests passing verified via `cargo test --release`\n- M5 (Benchmark Stability): All Criterion benchmarks have CV < 10%, verified by parsing estimates.json files and checking `max(cv_percent) < 10.0`\n- AC1.1: `cargo build --release` completes successfully with new [profile.release] configuration (lto=fat, codegen-units=1, strip=true, panic=abort, opt-level=3)\n- AC1.2: Binary size \u2264500KB measured via `stat -f%z target/release/pyrust` (current 577KB baseline)\n- AC1.3: Binary startup overhead \u2264500\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 100 runs with 95% CI upper bound check\n- AC1.4: All 664 currently passing tests still pass after binary optimization changes, no regressions\n- AC1.5: Library API performance unchanged at 293ns \u00b110% verified via existing Criterion benchmarks\n- AC2.1: `pyrust --daemon` starts server successfully, creates Unix socket at /tmp/pyrust.sock and PID file at /tmp/pyrust.pid\n- AC2.2: `pyrust -c '2+3'` with daemon running returns correct output in <190\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 1000 runs\n- AC2.3: `pyrust --stop-daemon` shuts down daemon cleanly, removes socket and PID files, verified by checking file deletion\n- AC2.4: Daemon fallback works - if socket missing, direct execution succeeds and returns correct result\n- AC2.5: Error propagation - daemon returns identical error format as direct execution for division by zero, undefined variables, syntax errors\n- AC2.6: Concurrent requests - 10 parallel clients can send requests simultaneously without result corruption or crashes\n- AC2.7: Stress test - 10,000 sequential requests complete with <1% failure rate, no memory leaks, stable performance\n- AC3.1: Cache hit rate \u226595% for repeated code measured by benchmark with 100 identical requests to warm cache\n- AC3.2: Cached execution in daemon mode \u226450\u03bcs mean measured after cache warm-up with identical script\n- AC3.3: Cache miss performance within 5% of no-cache baseline, ensuring hash computation and insertion overhead is negligible\n- AC3.4: LRU eviction works correctly - 1001st unique script evicts oldest entry, verified by testing cache capacity limits\n- AC3.5: Memory usage \u226410MB for 1000 cached scripts measured via profiler or RSS measurement\n- AC3.6: Cache invalidation - different code produces different results, no hash collision false positives observed in 10,000 unique scripts\n- AC4.1: `cargo test --release` exits with code 0 showing 681/681 tests passed (100% pass rate)\n- AC4.2: No regressions - all 664 tests that currently pass still pass after bug fixes, verified by comparing test lists\n- AC4.3: Each of 14 specific failing tests passes individually when run in isolation: test_function_call_with_expression_args returns 100, test_function_calling_before_definition returns CompileError, test_function_calling_convention_multiple_args succeeds without parameter errors, test_function_using_param_in_multiple_operations returns 28, test_function_with_multiple_return_paths_early_return succeeds, test_function_with_negative_numbers returns -42, test_function_with_negative_parameters returns -30\n- AC4.4: Benchmark stability achieved - coefficient of variation < 10% for all benchmarks verified by parsing Criterion JSON estimates and checking std_dev/mean ratio\n- AC5.1: `pyrust -c '2+3' --profile` outputs human-readable table with 5 stage timings (lex, parse, compile, vm_execute, format) in nanoseconds\n- AC5.2: Sum of individual stage timings within 5% of total measured time, ensuring instrumentation accounts for full pipeline\n- AC5.3: `pyrust -c '2+3' --profile-json` outputs valid JSON matching PipelineProfile schema with fields lex_ns, parse_ns, compile_ns, vm_execute_ns, format_ns, total_ns\n- AC5.4: Profiling overhead \u22641% measured by comparing execute_python vs execute_python_profiled in dedicated benchmark\n- AC5.5: PERFORMANCE.md updated with profiling data including stage breakdown table showing percentage of total time per stage\n- AC6.1: Binary subprocess benchmark mean \u2264380\u03bcs verified in benches/binary_subprocess.rs Criterion output\n- AC6.2: Daemon mode benchmark mean \u2264190\u03bcs verified in benches/daemon_mode.rs Criterion output\n- AC6.3: Cache hit benchmark mean \u226450\u03bcs verified in benches/cache_performance.rs for warm cache scenario\n- AC6.4: All benchmarks show CV < 10% ensuring statistical stability and reproducible results\n- AC6.5: `scripts/validate_speedup.sh` exits with code 0 indicating \u226550x speedup achieved vs CPython baseline\n- AC6.6: PERFORMANCE.md completely updated with new baseline table showing binary/daemon/cached modes, speedup calculations with 95% CI, variance analysis, and interpretation\n### Architecture Summary\nComplete production-ready architecture transforming PyRust from 293ns library to 50-100x faster CLI (380\u03bcs binary, 190\u03bcs daemon, 50\u03bcs cached).
