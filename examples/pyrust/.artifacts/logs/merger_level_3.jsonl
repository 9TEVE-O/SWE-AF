Starts daemon, warms up, measures 1000 requests via Criterion. Validates 100x speedup target (\u2264190\u03bcs mean).\n  Result: All acceptance criteria met: mean latency 7.94\u03bcs (\u2264190\u03bcs target), CV 6.34% (<10% target), connection reuse working, benchmark isolation correct. Tests pass, code review approved with no blocking issues. Implementation is production-ready.\n  Files changed: benches/daemon_mode.rs, scripts/validate_daemon_speedup.sh, Cargo.toml, src/daemon.rs, tests/test_daemon_mode_edge_cases.rs\n\n**issue/20-cache-performance-benchmark** (issue: cache-performance-benchmark)\n  Description: Implement benches/cache_performance.rs measuring cache hit latency (warm cache), cache miss latency, and hit rate.

Current binary execution is 1.3ms (14x speedup) due to process overhead. Solution: (1) Binary optimization with LTO, single codegen unit, symbol stripping to reduce startup to <500\u03bcs, (2) Daemon mode with Unix socket IPC for <190\u03bcs per-request latency amortizing process spawn, (3) Compilation caching with in-memory LRU+SipHash for <50\u03bcs cached execution, (4) Fix 14 failing tests (7 function parameter bugs, 2 negative number parsing, 5 benchmark stability), (5) Add profiling infrastructure for per-stage timing breakdown.

Validates stability, correctness, and error handling under load.\n  Result: All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage. Tests pass: AC2.6 (10 parallel clients with 3 test variants), AC2.7 (0.00% failure rate on 10K requests), memory stability confirmed, performance degradation 8.96% (< 20% threshold), M2 latency 70\u03bcs (< 190\u03bcs required). Code review approved with no blocking issues. 4 debt items tracked for future improvement but don't block approval.\n  Files changed: tests/test_daemon_concurrency.rs\n\n### Known File Conflicts (advance warning)\n- `Cargo.toml` modified by: ['binary-optimization', 'compilation-cache']\n- `src/compiler.rs` modified by: ['function-parameter-bug-1', 'function-parameter-bug-2', 'function-parameter-bug-3']\n- `src/vm.rs` modified by: ['function-parameter-bug-4', 'function-parameter-bug-5']\n- `Cargo.toml` modified by: ['binary-subprocess-benchmark', 'daemon-server']\n- `Cargo.toml` modified by: ['daemon-mode-benchmark', 'cache-performance-benchmark']\n\n### PRD Summary\nTransform PyRust from library-optimized (293ns, 66,000x faster) to production-ready CLI achieving 50-100x end-to-end speedup vs CPython (19ms baseline). Current binary execution is 1.3ms (14x speedup) due to process overhead. Solution: (1) Binary optimization with LTO, single codegen unit, symbol stripping to reduce startup to <500\u03bcs, (2) Daemon mode with Unix socket IPC for <190\u03bcs per-request latency amortizing process spawn, (3) Compilation caching with in-memory LRU+SipHash for <50\u03bcs cached execution, (4) Fix 14 failing tests (7 function parameter bugs, 2 negative number parsing, 5 benchmark stability), (5) Add profiling infrastructure for per-stage timing breakdown. Target: `pyrust -c '2+3'` executes in \u2264380\u03bcs mean (binary) or \u2264190\u03bcs (daemon), validated via hyperfine with statistical confidence.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- M1 (Binary Speedup 50x): Binary subprocess execution \u2264380\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 100 runs with 95% CI, automated check `mean_us <= 380` in validation script\n- M2 (Daemon Speedup 100x): Per-request latency in daemon mode \u2264190\u03bcs mean measured via custom benchmark client with 1000 requests, automated check `mean_us <= 190`\n- M3 (Test Regression): All 664 currently passing tests still pass, verified via `cargo test --release` with exit code 0 and 0 failures\n- M4 (Function Bugs Fixed): All 14 failing tests now pass (7 function parameter handling, 2 negative number parsing, 5 benchmark stability), total 681/681 tests passing verified via `cargo test --release`\n- M5 (Benchmark Stability): All Criterion benchmarks have CV < 10%, verified by parsing estimates.json files and checking `max(cv_percent) < 10.0`\n- AC1.1: `cargo build --release` completes successfully with new [profile.release] configuration (lto=fat, codegen-units=1, strip=true, panic=abort, opt-level=3)\n- AC1.2: Binary size \u2264500KB measured via `stat -f%z target/release/pyrust` (current 577KB baseline)\n- AC1.3: Binary startup overhead \u2264500\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 100 runs with 95% CI upper bound check\n- AC1.4: All 664 currently passing tests still pass after binary optimization changes, no regressions\n- AC1.5: Library API performance unchanged at 293ns \u00b110% verified via existing Criterion benchmarks\n- AC2.1: `pyrust --daemon` starts server successfully, creates Unix socket at /tmp/pyrust.sock and PID file at /tmp/pyrust.pid\n- AC2.2: `pyrust -c '2+3'` with daemon running returns correct output in <190\u03bcs mean measured via hyperfine 1000 runs\n- AC2.3: `pyrust --stop-daemon` shuts down daemon cleanly, removes socket and PID files, verified by checking file deletion\n- AC2.4: Daemon fallback works - if socket missing, direct execution succeeds and returns correct result\n- AC2.5: Error propagation - daemon returns identical error format as direct execution for division by zero, undefined variables, syntax errors\n- AC2.6: Concurrent requests - 10 parallel clients can send requests simultaneously without result corruption or crashes\n- AC2.7: Stress test - 10,000 sequential requests complete with <1% failure rate, no memory leaks, stable performance\n- AC3.1: Cache hit rate \u226595% for repeated code measured by benchmark with 100 identical requests to warm cache\n- AC3.2: Cached execution in daemon mode \u226450\u03bcs mean measured after cache warm-up with identical script\n- AC3.3: Cache miss performance within 5% of no-cache baseline, ensuring hash computation and insertion overhead is negligible\n- AC3.4: LRU eviction works correctly - 1001st unique script evicts oldest entry, verified by testing cache capacity limits\n- AC3.5: Memory usage \u226410MB for 1000 cached scripts measured via profiler or RSS measurement\n- AC3.6: Cache invalidation - different code produces different results, no hash collision false positives observed in 10,000 unique scripts\n- AC4.1: `cargo test --release` exits with code 0 showing 681/681 tests passed (100% pass rate)\n- AC4.2: No regressions - all 664 tests that currently pass still pass after bug fixes, verified by comparing test lists\n- AC4.3: Each of 14 specific failing tests passes individually when run in isolation: test_function_call_with_expression_args returns 100, test_function_calling_before_definition returns CompileError, test_function_calling_convention_multiple_args succeeds without parameter errors, test_function_using_param_in_multiple_operations returns 28, test_function_with_multiple_return_paths_early_return succeeds, test_function_with_negative_numbers returns -42, test_function_with_negative_parameters returns -30\n- AC4.4: Benchmark stability achieved - coefficient of variation < 10% for all benchmarks verified by parsing Criterion JSON estimates and checking std_dev/mean ratio\n- AC5.1: `pyrust -c '2+3' --profile` outputs human-readable table with 5 stage timings (lex, parse, compile, vm_execute, format) in nanoseconds\n- AC5.2: Sum of individual stage timings within 5% of total measured time, ensuring instrumentation accounts for full pipeline\n- AC5.3: `pyrust -c '2+3' --profile-json` outputs valid JSON matching PipelineProfile schema with fields lex_ns, parse_ns, compile_ns, vm_execute_ns, format_ns, total_ns\n- AC5.4: Profiling overhead \u22641% measured by comparing execute_python vs execute_python_profiled in dedicated benchmark\n- AC5.5: PERFORMANCE.md updated with profiling data including stage breakdown table showing percentage of total time per stage\n- AC6.1: Binary subprocess benchmark mean \u2264380\u03bcs verified in benches/binary_subprocess.rs Criterion output\n- AC6.2: Daemon mode benchmark mean \u2264190\u03bcs verified in benches/daemon_mode.rs Criterion output\n- AC6.3: Cache hit benchmark mean \u226450\u03bcs verified in benches/cache_performance.rs for warm cache scenario\n- AC6.4: All benchmarks show CV < 10% ensuring statistical stability and reproducible results\n- AC6.5: `scripts/validate_speedup.sh` exits with code 0 indicating \u226550x speedup achieved vs CPython baseline\n- AC6.6: PERFORMANCE.md completely updated with new baseline table showing binary/daemon/cached modes, speedup calculations with 95% CI, variance analysis, and interpretation\n\n### Architecture Summary\nComplete production-ready architecture transforming PyRust from 293ns library to 50-100x faster CLI (380\u03bcs binary, 190\u03bcs daemon, 50\u03bcs cached). Addresses all tech lead concerns with FULL specifications for 6 phases: (1) Binary optimization via LTO+static linking, (2) Unix socket daemon with signal handling, (3) LRU cache with collision detection, (4) 14 bug fixes with exact file locations and code changes, (5) Profiling infrastructure with PipelineProfile struct and CLI integration, (6) Comprehensive benchmark suite with validation scripts.
