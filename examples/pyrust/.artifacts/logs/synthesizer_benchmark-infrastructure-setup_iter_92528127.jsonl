{"ts": 1770494674.3050969, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: benchmark-infrastructure-setup\n- **Title**: Set up Criterion benchmark infrastructure and verify it runs\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC1.1 (partial): cargo bench --bench startup_benchmarks exits with code 0\n  - Benchmark compiles without errors\n  - Can execute execute_python() from benchmark code\n  - Criterion outputs basic timing results\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: All acceptance criteria PASSED. Benchmark infrastructure setup is complete and functional: (1) cargo bench --bench startup_benchmarks exits with code 0, (2) benchmark compiles without errors in release mode, (3) execute_python() successfully called from three benchmark scenarios (arithmetic, empty program, print statement), (4) Criterion outputs comprehensive timing results (280ns, 94ns, 287ns respectively) with statistical analysis. Coverage: 100% of acceptance criteria verified. Implementation quality: excellent - follows Criterion best practices with proper black_box usage, no unsafe code, clean structure. Note: Library tests fail to compile due to unrelated function implementation work (DefineFunction/Call/Return bytecode handlers missing in VM), but this is out of scope for benchmark infrastructure setup and was introduced by subsequent commits.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/92528127/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Benchmark infrastructure successfully set up. Cargo.toml correctly configures Criterion 0.5 as dev-dependency with harness=false. The benches/startup_benchmarks.rs file implements three minimal benchmarks (simple_python_execution, empty_program, print_statement) that properly call execute_python() using black_box to prevent optimizations. All acceptance criteria met: benchmark compiles without errors, can execute execute_python() from benchmark code, and Criterion will output basic timing results. No blocking issues found. Two SHOULD_FIX items noted: (1) missing verification evidence that cargo bench was actually run to confirm the claimed timing results, and (2) minor naming inconsistency with architecture doc which mentions 'cold_start_simple' but implementation uses different names. These are documentation/verification concerns that don't impact core functionality.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/92528127/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Missing benchmark execution verification: The coder claims specific timing results (260ns, 93ns, 280ns) but no evidence in artifacts that cargo bench was run. Should include actual benchmark output to verify functionality.\n  - [should_fix] Benchmark naming inconsistency with architecture: Architecture doc mentions 'cold_start_simple' benchmark name, but implementation uses 'simple_python_execution', 'empty_program', 'print_statement'. Minor inconsistency between spec and implementation.\n  - [suggestion] Limited benchmark scope for future expansion: Benchmarks test only very simple cases. Could benefit from more comprehensive benchmarks measuring compilation and execution separately.\n  - [suggestion] Missing module-level documentation: Benchmark file lacks module doc comment explaining purpose and scope of these minimal infrastructure benchmarks.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/92528127`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/92528127/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
