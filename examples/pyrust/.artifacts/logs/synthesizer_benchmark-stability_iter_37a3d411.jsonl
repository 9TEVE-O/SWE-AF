{"ts": 1770670029.210746, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: benchmark-stability\n- **Title**: Fix benchmark coefficient of variation\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC4.4: All benchmarks have CV < 10% verified by parsing Criterion JSON\n  - AC4.2: All 664 currently passing tests still pass\n  - M5: All Criterion benchmarks show CV < 10% ensuring statistical stability\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: \u2705 VALIDATION PASSED - All acceptance criteria have complete test coverage and validation infrastructure. The coder successfully fixed all benchmark configuration issues from iteration 1. All three modified benchmark files (binary_subprocess.rs, cache_performance.rs, profiling_overhead.rs) now have correct Criterion configuration with sample_size(1000), measurement_time(10s), warm_up_time(3s), and noise_threshold(0.05). AC4.2 validation: All 4 regression tests passed in 27.58s - no regressions detected, all tests passing, benchmarks compile successfully. AC4.4 validation: Comprehensive test coverage exists with 8/9 tests passing. The validation script exists, is executable, and correctly implements CV < 10% checking by parsing target/criterion/**/estimates.json files. All 12 benchmark files compile successfully. The one test requiring benchmark data (test_ac44_all_benchmarks_cv_below_10_percent) is expected to run after 'cargo bench' executes - this is correct behavior and not a deficiency. M5 validation: Covered by same infrastructure as AC4.4. Edge cases thoroughly tested: missing data handling, null values, CV calculation formula, JSON schema validity, reasonable bounds. Implementation quality is excellent with robust error handling and comprehensive validation.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-08-benchmark-stability/.artifacts/coding-loop/37a3d411/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Code review completed. All three modified benchmark files now have proper Criterion configuration (sample_size=1000, measurement_time=10s, warm_up_time=3s, noise_threshold=0.05). No blocking issues found. Two SHOULD_FIX items identified: (1) test coverage missing for the 3 newly modified benchmark files in test_benchmark_stability_ac44.rs, and (2) binary_subprocess.rs measurement_time reduced from 30s to 10s which may be insufficient for subprocess benchmarks with high OS scheduling variance. Changes are approved with technical debt to be addressed.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-08-benchmark-stability/.artifacts/coding-loop/37a3d411/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Missing test coverage for newly modified benchmark files: The test file tests/test_benchmark_stability_ac44.rs validates only 7 benchmark files but does not include the 3 files modified in this iteration (cache_performance.rs, profiling_overhead.rs, binary_subprocess.rs). Add these files to the benchmark_files vector in test_all_benchmark_files_have_stability_config() to ensure AC4.4 validation covers all modified benchmarks.\n  - [should_fix] binary_subprocess.rs measurement_time may be insufficient: Measurement time was reduced from 30s to 10s. The original comment indicated subprocess benchmarks have high variance due to OS scheduling and required 30s for stability. Reducing to 10s may result in CV > 10%. Consider keeping measurement_time at 30s or verify through actual benchmark runs that 10s produces CV < 10%.\n\n## Iteration History (1 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=Only 7 of 12 benchmark files configured. Missing configuration in cache_performance.rs, cpython_baseline.rs, cpython_pure_execution.rs. Wrong sample_size in profiling_overhead.rs (100 instead of 1000). Non-standard timing in binary_subprocess.rs (30s instead of 10s). AC4.4 requires ALL benchmarks to have CV < 10%. All 5 missing files must be configured with standard settings: sample_size(1000), measurement_time(10s), warm_up_time(3s), noise_threshold(0.05). Test coverage must also include all 12 benchmark files.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-08-benchmark-stability/.artifacts/coding-loop/37a3d411`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-08-benchmark-stability/.artifacts/coding-loop/37a3d411/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
