{"ts": 1770659166.729344, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: bug-fixes-verification\n- **Title**: Verify all 681 tests pass after bug fixes\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC4.1: cargo test --release exits with code 0 showing 681/681 tests passed\n  - AC4.2: All 664 tests that currently pass still pass\n  - M4: 14 failing tests now pass, total 681/681 tests passing\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: \u2705 ALL TESTS PASSED - 811/811 tests passing (100% pass rate). All acceptance criteria validated:\n\n**AC4.1**: cargo test --release exits with code 0 \u2713\n**AC4.2**: No test regressions - all previously passing tests still pass \u2713\n**M4**: 100% pass rate achieved (811 tests vs 681 target) \u2713\n\nCoverage Analysis:\n- Validation script (scripts/validate_test_status.sh) comprehensively tests all ACs\n- 11 dedicated tests in test_bug_fixes_verification.rs validate the validation script\n- Function parameter bugs fixed and tested (7 bugs)\n- Negative number parsing fixed and tested (2 bugs)\n- PyO3 compatibility issue resolved with PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1\n\nTest count exceeds PRD target (811 vs 681) due to comprehensive test coverage added during implementation, which is a positive outcome. The key requirement - 100% pass rate with 0 failures - has been achieved.\n\nEdge cases tested:\n- Empty test suites\n- Validation script error handling\n- Function parameter edge cases\n- Negative number edge cases\n- Multiple parameter operations\n\nNo test failures to report. All implementation is correct and complete.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-12-bug-fixes-verification/.artifacts/coding-loop/28711a18/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: All 811 tests pass (100% pass rate, 0 failures). PyO3 build compatibility issue resolved by setting PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1. All acceptance criteria met: AC4.1 (exit code 0), AC4.2 (no regressions), M4 (100% pass rate). Test count exceeds PRD target (811 vs 681) due to comprehensive test coverage added during implementation. No blocking issues found - code is approved for merge.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-12-bug-fixes-verification/.artifacts/coding-loop/28711a18/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Test Count Discrepancy Documentation: PRD explicitly specifies 681/681 tests but actual count is 811 tests. While TEST_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md explains this (additional tests for comprehensive coverage), the PRD acceptance criteria should be updated to reflect actual test count or provide formal variance approval.\n  - [should_fix] Missing Test Execution Evidence in Review: Validation script was not executed during this review iteration. While test_output_fixed.txt shows previous execution, best practice is to re-run tests during review to catch environmental issues.\n  - [suggestion] Verbose Script Comments: The comment explanation in scripts/validate_test_status.sh (lines 76-85) about test count discrepancy is quite verbose. Script comments should be brief.\n  - [suggestion] Evidence Document Missing Git History: TEST_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md doesn't reference the git commits that implemented the 14 bug fixes, reducing traceability.\n\n## Iteration History (2 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=One trivial fix required: Performance test 'test_encode_performance_request' has 5\u03bcs threshold but actual time is 8.083\u03bcs. Change threshold to 10\u03bcs in src/daemon_protocol.rs. This will fix both failing tests and achieve 100% pass rate (1203/1203). All functional tests already pass, all bug fixes verified, no regressions. AC4.1 requires exit code 0 which is currently blocked only by this performance timing issue.\n- **Iteration 2**: action=fix, summary=Code changes are correct (performance thresholds updated 5\u03bcs\u219210\u03bcs), but verification incomplete. test_output.txt shows PyO3 build failure (Python 3.13 vs 3.12 incompatibility). Tests never ran. Required: Fix PyO3 build issue (set PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1), re-run cargo test --release, provide evidence of exit code 0. Secondary: Explain test count discrepancy (811 vs 681 expected).\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-12-bug-fixes-verification/.artifacts/coding-loop/28711a18`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-12-bug-fixes-verification/.artifacts/coding-loop/28711a18/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
