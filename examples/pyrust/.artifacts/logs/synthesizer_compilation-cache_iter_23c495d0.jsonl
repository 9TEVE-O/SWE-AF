{"ts": 1770669786.605582, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: compilation-cache\n- **Title**: Implement LRU compilation cache\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC3.1: Cache hit rate \u226595% for repeated code (100 identical requests)\n  - AC3.4: LRU eviction works - 1001st entry evicts oldest\n  - AC3.5: Memory usage \u226410MB for 1000 cached scripts\n  - AC3.6: Cache invalidation - different code produces different results\n  - Cache hit lookup completes in <50\u03bcs\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: All 462 library tests passed successfully. Comprehensive test coverage for all acceptance criteria: AC3.1 (\u226595% cache hit rate - achieved 99%), AC3.4 (LRU eviction - validated with 1000-entry cache), AC3.5 (\u226410MB memory usage - actual ~306KB, 33x better), AC3.6 (collision detection - full source comparison validated), and implicit cache hit latency <50\u03bcs (actual ~63.7ns, 785x better than target). The implementation includes 38 cache-specific unit tests plus 8 comprehensive benchmark scenarios. Zero edge cases uncovered requiring additional tests - the coder has already implemented exceptional coverage including empty strings, whitespace-only, Unicode characters, hash collisions, LRU edge cases, zero/single-entry caches, and stress tests with 200+ operations. Performance benchmarks confirm cache hit lookup completes in ~63.7 nanoseconds (0.0637\u03bcs), exceeding the <50\u03bcs requirement by 785x. Memory footprint estimate shows ~306KB for 1000 entries, well under the 10MB limit. All integration tests validate real-world usage patterns. No test failures or coverage gaps identified.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-10-compilation-cache/.artifacts/coding-loop/23c495d0/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Implementation APPROVED. The compilation cache is comprehensive, well-tested, and meets all acceptance criteria. Cache achieves 99% hit rate (exceeding 95% requirement), proper LRU eviction for 1001st entry, memory usage well under 10MB limit (~306KB for 1000 entries), correct collision detection with different code producing different results, and cache hit latency of ~79ns (630x faster than 50\u03bcs requirement). Integration with both thread-local (library mode) and global (daemon mode) caches is properly implemented. All 462 library tests pass including 38 comprehensive cache unit tests. Three non-blocking suggestions identified: (1) add automated performance assertion test for <50\u03bcs latency, (2) minor test file naming consistency, (3) update DefaultHasher documentation accuracy. No security vulnerabilities, crashes, data loss, or algorithmic issues found.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-10-compilation-cache/.artifacts/coding-loop/23c495d0/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Missing automated test for cache hit latency requirement: While benchmarks confirm ~79ns cache hit latency (well under 50\u03bcs requirement), there is no automated test that fails if latency exceeds threshold. Consider adding integration test with performance assertion for continuous validation.\n  - [suggestion] Test file naming consistency: Test file uses 'test_cache_integration.rs' naming but existing tests use bare names like 'integration_test.rs' without 'test_' prefix\n  - [suggestion] DefaultHasher documentation accuracy: Comment mentions 'SipHash 1-3' but DefaultHasher is implementation-defined and can change between Rust versions\n  - [suggestion] Confusing code comment reference: Comment mentions 'lru_order vector' which doesn't exist in implementation (uses timestamp-based tracking instead)\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-10-compilation-cache/.artifacts/coding-loop/23c495d0`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-10-compilation-cache/.artifacts/coding-loop/23c495d0/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
