Coder successfully removed the unused `functions` field from the Compiler struct. All 3 acceptance criteria verified: (1) Zero warnings about 'field functions never read', (2) Compilation succeeds with exit code 0, (3) No usages of self.functions remain in code. However, the coder wrote ZERO tests for this change. QA agent added 11 comprehensive integration tests covering all ACs, edge cases (empty programs, nested calls, recursive functions, multiple functions), and regression scenarios. All 483 existing library tests pass, plus all 11 new integration tests pass. The change is production-ready.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-02-compiler-dead-code-removal/.artifacts/coding-loop/6bd7e09c/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Changes successfully remove the unused `functions` HashMap field from the Compiler struct. All acceptance criteria met: no self.functions usages remain, struct definition is correct, and compilation will succeed. Code is clean, safe, and achieves the stated objectives.
