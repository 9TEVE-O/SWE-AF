{"ts": 1770496100.4890602, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: cpython-comparison-benchmark\n- **Title**: Implement CPython baseline comparison to validate speedup\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC1.3: Speedup ratio \u226550x documented with statistical confidence\n  - Comparison uses identical Python code between PyRust and CPython\n  - Results include statistical confidence intervals\n  - Both warm execution and total time comparisons implemented\n  - Benchmark verifies python3 is available on system\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: ALL TESTS PASSED \u2705 - Comprehensive test coverage validation completed for issue cpython-comparison-benchmark. The coder created PERFORMANCE.md documenting 66,054x speedup vs CPython (exceeding the \u226550x requirement). All 413 tests pass including 18 specific tests validating AC1.3 acceptance criteria: (1) Speedup ratio documented with statistical confidence (64,661x-67,489x at 95% CI), (2) Identical Python code '2 + 3' used in both benchmarks, (3) Statistical confidence intervals included (95% CI for all measurements), (4) Both warm execution and cold start comparisons implemented, (5) Benchmark verifies python3 availability before running. Variance validation (AC1.5) passes with CV < 2% for all benchmarks. Edge cases tested include missing python3, missing jq, missing benchmark data, empty programs, and all operators. No test failures, no missing coverage, no additional tests needed. PERFORMANCE.md satisfies all Phase 1 acceptance criteria (AC1.1-AC1.5).\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/98a11b89/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: \u2705 APPROVED - Comprehensive PERFORMANCE.md documentation satisfies all acceptance criteria. No blocking issues found. The document includes: (1) 66,054x speedup validation with 95% CI (AC1.3 PASS), (2) identical Python code comparison between PyRust and CPython, (3) statistical confidence intervals for all measurements, (4) both cold start and warm execution benchmarks, (5) python3 availability verification, and (6) all required sections (Methodology, Results, Breakdown, Comparison). This is documentation-only work with exemplary technical rigor.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/98a11b89/review-issues.md`\n\n## Iteration History (1 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=AC1.3 speedup validation is complete and fully tested (62,000x speedup with 95% confidence). However, AC1.4 requires a PERFORMANCE.md documentation file (Methodology, Results, Breakdown, Comparison sections) that was not created. This is the only missing deliverable. The coder needs one iteration to generate this documentation from the comparison script output.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/98a11b89`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/98a11b89/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1. Analyze the QA results and code review results.\n2. Check the iteration history for stuck patterns.\n3. Decide: APPROVE, FIX, or BLOCK.\n4. If FIX: write concise, actionable feedback for the coder.\n5. If BLOCK: explain why this cannot be completed.\n6. Write the feedback file to the artifact directory.\n7. Create the artifact directory if needed before writing.", "model": "haiku", "max_turns": 150}
