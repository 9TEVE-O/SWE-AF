{"ts": 1770495784.289442, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: cpython-comparison-benchmark\n- **Title**: Implement CPython baseline comparison to validate speedup\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC1.3: Speedup ratio \u226550x documented with statistical confidence\n  - Comparison uses identical Python code between PyRust and CPython\n  - Results include statistical confidence intervals\n  - Both warm execution and total time comparisons implemented\n  - Benchmark verifies python3 is available on system\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: All acceptance criteria validated successfully with comprehensive test coverage. Created 18 new tests in tests/test_cpython_comparison.rs covering: (1) AC1.3 speedup ratio validation (measured ~62,000x, far exceeding 50x target with 95% confidence), (2) identical Python code usage in both CPython and PyRust benchmarks ('2 + 3'), (3) statistical confidence interval extraction and reporting, (4) both warm execution and total time comparisons via speedup_comparison benchmark group, (5) python3 availability verification before running benchmarks. All edge cases tested including missing dependencies, missing benchmark data, and error handling. The compare_cpython.sh script executes successfully and validates AC1.3 with output showing conservative speedup of 61,642x \u2265 50x (95% confidence). All 126 existing tests continue to pass (78 unit + 38 integration + 10 doc tests). No test failures detected. Implementation is complete and production-ready.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cc4c9149/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Code review APPROVED. The CPython comparison script (scripts/compare_cpython.sh) is functionally complete and correct. All comparison-specific acceptance criteria are met: speedup calculation with statistical confidence (AC1.3), identical Python code usage, 95% confidence intervals, warm execution and total time comparisons, and python3 availability verification. The implementation is secure with no vulnerabilities, crashes, or incorrect algorithms. However, there is one SHOULD_FIX issue: the missing PERFORMANCE.md documentation file required by AC1.4. The PRD explicitly requires this deliverable with sections for Methodology, Results, Breakdown, and Comparison. While the comparison script generates comprehensive output, it only prints to stdout rather than creating the documented artifact. This is a documentation gap, not a functional blocker. Two minor SUGGESTION-level issues were identified regarding code readability and error handling validation.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cc4c9149/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] PERFORMANCE.md documentation not created (AC1.4): The PRD requires AC1.4 to be satisfied with a PERFORMANCE.md file containing sections: Methodology, Results, Breakdown, and Comparison. The issue description explicitly states this work 'Delivers PERFORMANCE.md documentation'. However, no PERFORMANCE.md file was created. The comparison script only outputs to stdout. This prevents users from referencing documented performance characteristics and lacks a baseline for future performance regression tracking.\n  - [suggestion] Variable expansion readability in output formatting: Lines 159, 165, 175, 176 in scripts/compare_cpython.sh use nested shell and Python variable expansion that is hard to read: echo -e \"  CV:         ${cpython_cv} ($(python3 -c \"print(f'{${cpython_cv} * 100:.1f}')\" )\")%\". This mixes shell variable expansion with Python f-string syntax, creating visual confusion. The code works correctly but is harder to maintain.\n  - [suggestion] Add validation for jq JSON extraction: The extract_timing() function (lines 71-76) uses jq to extract JSON values but doesn't validate that the values are valid numbers. If the JSON structure is unexpected or jq fails, variables could be empty/null, leading to cryptic errors in later calculations. Impact is low as Criterion's JSON format is stable.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cc4c9149`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/coding-loop/cc4c9149/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
