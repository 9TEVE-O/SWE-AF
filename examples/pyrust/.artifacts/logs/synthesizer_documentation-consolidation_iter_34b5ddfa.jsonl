Test coverage is comprehensive with 9/9 acceptance criteria validated, plus 28 additional tests for internal links, edge cases, and content quality. Fixed a bug in test_documentation_links.sh (grep command handling zero matches) and added test_documentation_edge_cases.sh with 15 additional edge case tests covering file system properties, content quality, naming conventions, and repository cleanliness. The coder's implementation correctly moved all 5 documentation files to docs/ directory, updated all internal markdown links in README.md and docs/performance.md, created docs/README.md as an index, and maintained the root README.md. Zero test failures detected.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-13-documentation-consolidation/.artifacts/coding-loop/34b5ddfa/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: False\n- **Blocking issues**: True\n- **Summary**: The coder successfully fixed 8 broken internal markdown links in README.md and docs/performance.md after documentation consolidation. All 9 acceptance criteria for the documentation structure pass. However, there is 1 BLOCKING issue: the test file tests/test_performance_documentation.rs still references the old PERFORMANCE.md path (35+ occurrences) instead of docs/performance.md, which will cause all tests in that file to fail. This breaks acceptance criteria validation and CI/CD pipeline.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-13-documentation-consolidation/.artifacts/coding-loop/34b5ddfa/review-issues.md`\n\n## Iteration History (1 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=Documentation consolidation partially complete: all 9 acceptance criteria passed, but 8 broken internal links found across 2 files (README.md and docs/performance.md). Code review missed link validation. Fixes are straightforward: update old filenames (IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md, PERFORMANCE.md) to new paths (docs/implementation-notes.md, docs/performance.md) in 2 files, 8 total line changes required. Current pass rate: 20/22 tests (90.9%).\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-13-documentation-consolidation/.artifacts/coding-loop/34b5ddfa`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-13-documentation-consolidation/.artifacts/coding-loop/34b5ddfa/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
