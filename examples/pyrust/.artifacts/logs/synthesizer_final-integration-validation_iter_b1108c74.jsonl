{"ts": 1770674287.851928, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: final-integration-validation\n- **Title**: Run complete end-to-end validation of all metrics\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - M1: Binary subprocess \u2264380\u03bcs mean with 95% CI (50x speedup)\n  - M2: Daemon mode \u2264190\u03bcs mean (100x speedup)\n  - M3: All 664 currently passing tests still pass\n  - M4: 681/681 tests passing (100% pass rate)\n  - M5: All benchmarks CV < 10%\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: All tests PASSED \u2713 (50/50 tests). The division by zero fix in scripts/final_validation.sh is working correctly. The fix adds a zero-check before calculating pass percentage, preventing crashes when METRIC_RESULTS array is empty. All acceptance criteria (M1-M5) are fully covered by comprehensive tests including: structure validation (10 tests), edge cases (12 tests), end-to-end behavior (12 tests), acceptance criteria coverage (9 tests), and fix-specific validation (7 tests). No regressions detected. The script properly handles empty arrays by displaying 'N/A (no metrics ran)' instead of crashing. Production-ready.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-23-final-integration-validation/.artifacts/coding-loop/b1108c74/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Code review APPROVED. The coder successfully fixed the division by zero error on line 283 of scripts/final_validation.sh by adding a conditional check before the percentage calculation. The fix correctly handles the edge case where METRIC_RESULTS array is empty, displaying 'N/A (no metrics ran)' instead of crashing. All 5 metrics (M1-M5) are properly validated, comprehensive error handling is in place, and no security vulnerabilities were found. No blocking, should-fix, or suggestion issues remain. Implementation is production-ready.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-23-final-integration-validation/.artifacts/coding-loop/b1108c74/review-issues.md`\n\n## Iteration History (1 previous)\n- **Iteration 1**: action=fix, summary=All tests pass (55/55) and M1-M5 criteria are fully covered, but found 1 BLOCKING issue: division by zero error on line 283 of scripts/final_validation.sh when METRIC_RESULTS array is empty. Script will crash instead of reporting failures. Fix required: add zero-check before percentage calculation. Otherwise implementation is production-ready.\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-23-final-integration-validation/.artifacts/coding-loop/b1108c74`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-23-final-integration-validation/.artifacts/coding-loop/b1108c74/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
