{"ts": 1770648287.4829419, "event": "start", "prompt": "## Issue Being Evaluated\n- **Name**: negative-number-parsing\n- **Title**: Add negative number literal support to parser\n- **Acceptance Criteria** (all must pass for APPROVE):\n  - AC4.3: test_function_with_negative_numbers returns -42\n  - AC4.3: test_function_with_negative_parameters returns -30\n  - AC4.2: All 664 currently passing tests still pass\n\n## QA Results\n- **Tests passed**: True\n- **Summary**: All acceptance criteria met. AC4.3: Both test_function_with_negative_numbers (returns -42) and test_function_with_negative_parameters (returns -30) pass successfully. AC4.2: All 664 currently passing tests still pass with no regressions. QA added 22 comprehensive edge case tests (all pass) covering double negation, mixed unary operators, negative literals in all binary operations, precedence, parentheses, large numbers, and Python semantics. Total test results: 703 passed, 3 failed (pre-existing bugs unrelated to negative number parsing), 3 ignored. The coder's implementation was minimal and correct - unary operator support was already present in the parser (lines 304-320 of src/parser.rs), only test updates were needed to remove should_panic attributes and fix test_parse_error_propagation to use a truly invalid expression.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-07-negative-number-parsing/.artifacts/coding-loop/56114eb5/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Code review APPROVED. The implementation correctly leverages existing unary operator support in the parser (lines 304-320 in src/parser.rs). Changes were minimal and appropriate: (1) Fixed two tests incorrectly marked as #[should_panic], (2) Updated test_parse_error_propagation to use a truly invalid expression. No blocking issues found. Two non-blocking suggestions documented: missing test execution verification and incomplete comment explaining parse error.\n- **Detailed issues**: `.artifacts/coding-loop/56114eb5/review-issues.md`\n- **Debt items**:\n  - [should_fix] Missing Test Coverage Verification: No test execution output confirms that test_function_with_negative_numbers and test_function_with_negative_parameters actually pass. While the parser implementation appears correct, concrete evidence is needed.\n  - [suggestion] Incomplete Comment in test_parse_error_propagation: Comment at line 270-272 in tests/test_cross_feature_integration.rs explains why the old expression is valid but not why the new expression is invalid\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-07-negative-number-parsing/.artifacts/coding-loop/56114eb5`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-07-negative-number-parsing/.artifacts/coding-loop/56114eb5/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
