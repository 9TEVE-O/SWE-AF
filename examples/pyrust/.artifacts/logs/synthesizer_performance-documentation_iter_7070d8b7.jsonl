Comprehensive test coverage validates AC6.6 (PERFORMANCE.md updated with baseline table for all modes, speedup calculations with 95% CI and statistical confidence, variance analysis explaining CV and benchmark stability) and AC5.5 (profile data integrated with stage breakdown showing percentages). Tests include coverage for all execution modes (binary/daemon/cached/CPython), 95% confidence intervals for speedup calculations, coefficient of variation explanations, stage-by-stage profiling with percentages, and edge cases. No missing coverage or test failures detected.\n- **Detailed failures**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-22-performance-documentation/.artifacts/coding-loop/7070d8b7/test-failures.md`\n\n## Code Review Results\n- **Approved**: True\n- **Blocking issues**: False\n- **Summary**: Code review APPROVED. All acceptance criteria met: AC6.6 (baseline table with all modes, speedup calculations with 95% CI, variance analysis with CV explanation) and AC5.5 (stage breakdown with percentages) fully implemented. PERFORMANCE.md completely rewritten with comprehensive performance analysis including statistical confidence intervals, detailed variance analysis, and stage-by-stage profiling breakdown. Test suite enhanced with 5 new tests validating all requirements. All 22 tests pass. No blocking, should_fix, or suggestion-level issues found. Implementation is complete, accurate, and production-ready.\n- **Detailed issues**: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-22-performance-documentation/.artifacts/coding-loop/7070d8b7/review-issues.md`\n\n## Artifact Directory\n`/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-22-performance-documentation/.artifacts/coding-loop/7070d8b7`\nWrite merged feedback to: `/Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.worktrees/issue-22-performance-documentation/.artifacts/coding-loop/7070d8b7/feedback.md`\n\n## Your Task\n1.
