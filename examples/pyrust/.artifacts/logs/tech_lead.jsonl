The architect has revised based on your\nprevious feedback. Check whether the concerns were addressed.\n\nRead both documents thoroughly, then assess:\n\n1. **Requirements coverage**: For each acceptance criterion in the PRD, identify\n   the specific architecture component and interface that satisfies it. Flag any\n   criterion without a clear implementation path.\n\n2. **Interface precision**: Are types, signatures, error cases, and edge behaviors\n   defined precisely enough that an autonomous agent could implement them without\n   guessing? Flag anything ambiguous.\n\n3. **Internal consistency**: Do all sections of the architecture agree with each\n   other? Check that interfaces used in data flow examples match their definitions,\n   that error types referenced in components match the error module, and that\n   component dependencies form a valid DAG.\n\n4. **Complexity calibration**: Is the design appropriately complex \u2014 neither more\n   nor less than the problem demands?\n\n5. **Scope alignment**: Does the architecture solve exactly what the PM specified?\n   Flag additions or omissions.\n\nWrite your review to: /Users/santoshkumarradha/Documents/agentfield/code/int-agentfield-examples/af-swe/example-pyrust/.artifacts/plan/review.md\n\nBe decisive. Your approval means autonomous agents can implement this safely.\nYour rejection means proceeding would cause rework or integration failures.\n", "model": "sonnet", "max_turns": 150}
