This sprint plan decomposes the production cleanup into 14 atomic issues organized across 5 sequential phases optimized for maximum parallelism and minimal critical path. **Phase 1 (8 parallel issues)** handles all independent code fixes, formatting, file cleanup, and configuration updates. **Phase 2 (2 parallel issues)** resolves remaining clippy warnings with file conflict dependencies. **Phase 3 (2 parallel issues)** creates production files (README, LICENSE). **Phase 4 (1 issue)** consolidates documentation after README exists. **Phase 5 (1 issue)** performs final validation of all 17 acceptance criteria. The plan addresses all 9 critical gaps from technical review: explicit AC16-AC17 verification via Component 14, Cargo.lock removal via git rm --cached in Component 7, complete clippy accounting (12 total warnings across Components 4-7, 9-10), body_len comprehensive search strategy in Component 3, Value Copy trait pre-verification in Component 10, internal markdown link checking in Component 13, inline contributing guidelines in Component 11 avoiding broken references, clear phased dependency graph, and compilation success verification throughout. Every PRD acceptance criterion (AC1-AC17) maps to at least one issue's acceptance criteria. File ownership conflicts resolved through sequencing: Component 9 runs after Component 2 (both touch compiler.rs), Component 10 runs after Component 3 (both touch vm.rs). Maximum safe parallelism achieved: 8 concurrent components in Phase 1, zero merge conflicts. Estimated total execution time: ~7 minutes (Phase 1: 2min, Phase 2: 1min, Phase 3: 30s, Phase 4: 30s, Phase 5: 3min rebuild+validation). All issues are autonomous-agent-ready with pre-verification steps, exact transformation rules, machine-executable acceptance criteria, and fallback strategies. Result: production-quality PyRust repository with zero warnings, complete documentation, verified binary characteristics, and comprehensive testing coverage.
